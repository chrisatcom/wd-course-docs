## Adding Minimal Structure

1. Add the Doctype declaration

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

2. Put the entire document in an HTML root element by adding an `<html>` start tag after the DOCTYPE and an `</html>` end tag at the very end of the text.

3. Next, create the document head that contains the title for the page. Insert `<head` and `</head>` tags before the content.
